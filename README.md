# Watch-App-UI
Made with Figma.....
The image quality might differ due to quality limitation of git hub.....
Why the quality will differ ? -> Because I have downloaded all the pics or took some snap shots direct from the official website after taking, I upscaled all the images after upscaling played with some color grading then used in figma and figma also take some quality space.
